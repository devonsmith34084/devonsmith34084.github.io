<h2>What I Want!</h2>
    <p>  In this blog I finally figured out what I'm going to talk about. Dance!
    I will be giving updates on a studio in Crystal Lake, Dance Force Studios.
    I'll write about classes, competitions, and video updates on their Youtube
    channel.</p>
<h2>Dance Force?</h2>
    <p>  Dance Force is fast growing studio with talented coaches and dancers. Dance Force
    Teams have taken home many trophies from major national competitions  one of
    which placed 3rd in worlds and going again next year to hopefully win 1st.</p>
